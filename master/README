This is the main directory for the master. The master is a subproject of the robot
project. The master is made to run on a Rabbit Semiconductor Rabbit 2000 board with
128K of RAM and 128K of flash. The master is also made to be tested on a POSIX system.

POSIX version uses files for communication. See filedefs for what files are used.
To simulate master-slavec comms from keyboard run masterfifo in one console and readsc 
in another. Since the comms are just files the master may also get input from other
sources.
