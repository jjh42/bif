This program is for programming the avrspsynth project. It works
on *nix systems. For help run it with --help.

The sounds are kept in linuxtoavr/sounds. They should be 8000hz, 16-bit
wav files. The header file that is generated is in linuxtoavr/sounds.h and
the input configuration file is in linuxtoavr/input.conf.

To test the flash you can pass it a --play <num> replacing num with the
number of the sound to extract. It will write 3 files in the current
directory:
    plain	Uncompressed of what is in the flash
    dec		16-bit linear signed version that is the uncompressed sound.
    hbit	8-bit linear signed version.
    uhbit	8-bit unsigned version.


Warning this program only works on systems that store LSB first.

The input.conf file contains explanations on the format. Besides programming
the AVR flash linuxtoavr also generates: 
sounds.h 	- a header file with the defines of the sounds
sounds.inc 	- like sounds.h but for the Atmel AVR assembler
sounds_*.c	- Language tables
