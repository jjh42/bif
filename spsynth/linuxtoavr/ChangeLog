	  header files.
	* parse.c: Likewise
	
2001-08-14  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added lex.l, yacc.y, parse.*
	* Input.conf is now a lot more complicated than before.

2001-08-08  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* bugfix: Checking problem.
	
2001-07-12  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sf.net>

	* Bug that put #ifdef instead of #ifndef in header file.
	
2001-06-13  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sf.net>
	* Made it output a sounds.inc (Atmel AVR Assembler 
	  compatible).
	* Made it start the index from 1 instead of 0.
	
2001-05-07  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Changed the sounds.h to make hex so that it's easier
	  for debugging.
	* input.conf: Bug with sorry.
	
2001-05-06  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added a uhbit that is the unsigned high bit.
	
2001-05-05  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added a hbit that dumps the high bit of the sound.
	
2001-05-03  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added a way to test the dump file by -p[index] and it
	  will output a raw and uncompressed version. Used it to
	  validate the dump file.
	  
2001-04-25  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* bugfix: Things were stored in the index wrong.
