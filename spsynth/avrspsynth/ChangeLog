2001-09-23  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sf.net>

	  meant it never received anything.

2001-09-05  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sf.net>
	* Incremented version.
	* Made the dump message send the dump type at 
	  the beginning of the message.

	* Converted to using the GNU GAS as the assembler.

2001-05-08  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* Made the RxBuffer size 20 so it fits a maximum length
	  'S' message.
	* Made it so that the PWM is initialized to 0xff.
	* bugfix: Putting more than one sound at a time in the queue
	  caused a problem.
	* bugfix: Interupts should have been disabled longer in
	  DoDecode.
	* bugfix: No longer sends something on the SPI at the beginning.
	* bugfix: When playing the next sound it would not check the 
	  CompressedBuffer at the beginning.

2001-05-06  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Incremented version.
	* Changed it so it does the signed to unsigned conversion
	  in DoDecode. Also saves only the high byte which gives 
	  room for a 20 item ToSay buffer.

2001-05-05  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* Decodes properly.

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: In DoDecode.

2001-05-03  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bugfix: Sending the address used RHIsr1 instead of RHSPIState
	  to get the pointer to the right byte to send.
	* bugfix: Fixed a bug in getting the index.
	* bugfix: Data should be decoded high nibble first.

2001-05-02  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: RLAddressL was set as R11 (the same as RLAddressM)
	  which caused problems.

2001-05-01  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: Problem in the SPI ISR that caused InvalidSPIStateErr.
	* bugfix: Problem that stopped the last 0xff bytes of a sound
	  from being played.
	* bugfix: Problem with the decompression algorithm.

2001-04-29  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: Problem in the SPI ISR.

2001-04-28  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: The same register that was used for loading the
	  the item to play was also used to checking the ToSay buffer
	  count.

2001-04-25  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: The DoDecode had an infinite loop.
	* bugfix: SPI was not reenabled if it was playing a sound
	  but there was nothing in the play buffer.
	* bugfix: brcc instead of brcs set meant that it never play
	  any sound.

2001-04-24  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version
	* bugfix: The SPI interupt never selected the flash
	* bugfix: The SPI interupt had a bug when it got to 19 it
	  thought it was an invalid state.
	* bugfix: brze instead of brnz meant that SPI never got
	  past step 19.

2001-04-14  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bugfix: The part to put stuff in the say buffer was 
	  completely wrong.

2001-04-11  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: The Read Flash compare was wrong.
	* bugfix: The Test message loaded stuff from the flash
	  high byte first which was the wrong way round.

2001-04-10  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* Cleaned up DoProgramMsg a bit.
	* Made it so that test sends a C on completion.
	* bugfix: Changed the commands for the flash chip so that they
	  work for SPI.
	* bugfix: Fixed infinite loop in test message.
	* bugfix: Fixed infinite loop in flash dump.
	* bugfix: Fixed exit problem with the program message.

2001-04-09  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* Error with RXTL  meant the GetUARTByte didn't work properly.
	  It also meant that it didn't return properly.
	* bugfix: ChipSelect was set to pin 3 instead of pin 2 so it
	  didn't work properly.
	* bugfix: Set memory (D) used Y instead X.

2001-04-08  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* bugfix: All the Program and Test messages for the flash
	  never enabled Tx so everything they transmitted was lost.

2001-04-06  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Incremented version.
	* Added the ability to make a tone with the PWM
	* Made it stop sending an H on startup.
	* Made it possible to select the flash in flash debug
	  mode.
	* Add documentation of about flash debug message in README.
	* Made it so that it will still go to sleep if there was 
	  something in the CompresedBuffer but no room in the PlayBuffer
	  (a common occurence).
	* bugfix: GetUARTByte called itself instead of GetUARTChar
	  thus creating an infinite loop.
	* bugfix: PORTB was not set up right.
	* bugfix: Error number was also sent as 0
	* bugfix: GetUARTChar tested UCSRB instead of UCSRA for data.
	* bugfix: A couple of .bytes instead of DBs meant that the Play
	  and Compressed buffers were always thought full (this meaning
	  it was never idle).
	* bugfix: Set memory (D) used Y instead of X so it didn't work.

2001-04-05  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* It is now in a working state for version etc.
	* Incremented version.
	* Made it send a 'S' at the beginning of a big message
	* Added a way to turn debug mode off and on over the coms
	  (flag messag
	* bugfix: It now sends RxMsg instead of TxMsg
	* bugfix: Fixed a bug in clearing the RxMsg length.
	* bugfix: A bug that if the TxBuf was full it wouldn't
	  double return.
	* bugfix: A bug that the Tx message was incorrectly saved
	  in TxMsg.
	* bugfix: An error in restoring the SPI forgot to clear
	  the SPI status.
	* bugfix: GetParity was called in a ISRs.
	* bugfix: An error in checking parity GetUARTByte
	* bugfix: Because interupts were not disabled UDR Empty
	  would interupt before the queue was filled which caused
	  only the message itself to be sent and stopped any more
	  messages from ever being sent.
	* bugfix: A return in UDR Empty Interupt caused the length
	  never be decremented so messages would send the first nibble
	  forever.

2001-04-04  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Increment version.
	* Several bugfixes. It now communicates with the computer
	  and can output and dump message.

2001-04-04  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bugfix: a bug that made it never think it had received
	  a message.
	* Added some temporary code for checking if it receives a message

2001-03-19  Jonathan Hunt  <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>

	* First program.
	* bugfix: a minor bug after the program that will cause
	  the temporary code to send an H on start up to fail.
