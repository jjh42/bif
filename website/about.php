<h1>About Project Bif</h1>
<p>Project Bif began in 1998. Although then it wasn't called Project Bif. It actually only
ever acquired the name Project Bif when this website was made because it needed a name.
Bif is an acronym for [ it's a secret ].
<!-- For people who read comments it stands for Backwards Into the Future -->
Project Bif is a project to make a robot. You may have heard of robots that do really cool stuff
 in the fields of science research, surgery and even exploration on other planets. But no other
 robot that I know of in the world is being developed for something as fundamental to humans
 as Bif is. Because Bif is being developed to do nothing. Doing nothing is something many humans
 have been doing for years but as far as I know this is the first time a robot has been developed
 that with the design goal of making it able to do nothing.

<p>
 Actually Bif is being made so that we (the makers) can learn more about - well - everything. Since
 1998 Bif and us have come a long way. Bif has gone from being a few drawings on scraps of paper
 to actually existing, driving and being able to navigate. But more importantly we have learnt
 more about electronics, programming (assembly language, C, C++, bash scripting, makefiles) and
 about managing a project.

<p>
 Currently Bif can move about on it's two tracks it can synthesis speech (barely understandable
 though) by putting words and syllables together.

<p>See the <a href="history.php">history page</a> for some more about the history of Bif and how
 it is progressing. Look at <a href="tech.php">the tech page</a> for more detail about how
 parts of Bif work. All of the Bif source code is available under the GPL in the unlikely event 
 of it being useful to someone else. It is 
 <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/bif">viewable online.</a>
