This is a project written by Jonathan Hunt <jhuntnz@users.sourceforge.net>
to run on a Atmel <www.atmel.com> AVR AT90S8515 processor. This processor
has 512 bytes of EEPROM and RAM and 4096 words of flash (8k bytes).

This project uses a coms protocol for the UART described in CommsProtcol.txt which
is not included in this project.

It was written to control the bottom of a robot. It has inputs from the
tracks (yet to be done). It has outputs to a MM5051 which is a serial latch
hooked up to 30 LEDs on the outside of the robot. Look in base.s for more
details.

For the most part this project functions although the go message is done on
time at the moment. In the future I hope to change this to be done using
feedback from the tracks. That part is waiting for the hardware.

This program assembles and links successfully using GNU AVR binutils.
